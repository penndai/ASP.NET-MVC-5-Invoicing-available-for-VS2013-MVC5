# ASP.NET MVC3 Invoicing Application

 * This is a **sample invoicing application** used for **ASP.NET MVC3 training purposes**. 
 * This is a good code base to learn ASP.NET MVC3, since it covers many areas and development techniques.
 * I am using it as a personal invoicing tool for my freelancing activity, you may use it as well for this or any other purpose (it is very **easy to customize** to fit your needs) 
 * The solution has been created with **Visual Studio 2010 Express**, but you can open it with other versions of VS 2010.
 * Unit tests have been written with [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/). [Moq](http://code.google.com/p/moq/) has been used for object mocking.

## Online Demo

[Check the online demo here](http://www.vitaminasdev.com/invoicing)

## How to best use this code:

 * This application shows **how to create an ASP.NET MVC application from scratch.** and how to use some of the cool features of ASP.NET MVC3 like:
   * **Code First**
   * **Entity Framework** and **LINQ**
   * **Razor** view engine 
   * **Custom Membership Provider** pointing to your own database users table.
   * **Partial views** and **partial actions** (with independent OutputCache for high concurrency page rendering) 
   * **Html Helpers**
   * **Data Annotation** validation
   * **AJAX** partial rendering
   * Custom **T4 templates** for customized scaffolding
   * **NUnit** for unit testing and **Moq for object mocking**.
 * Every major development on this invoicing app has been tagged (0.1, 0.2, etc...)
 * You can download each tag (starting with 0.1), check progress and move to the next when you understood everything that has been done.
 * Follow the change log (tag history) and enjoy!

## Installation

 * Download the code and open with Visual Studio 2010 Express or above.
 * NuGet packages are included. If you have any problem please follow [this instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6876732/how-do-i-get-nuget-to-install-update-all-the-packages-in-the-packages-config)
 * By default the project is using SQL Server Compact database. You can easily change it to use SQL Server Express or above by modifying web.config file (connectionStrings section).
 * By using Code First and EF 4.1 the database will be recreated when you first run the project.

### Altering connectionStrings section 

Based on convention, EF will look for a connection strign named as the DBContext (in this case "InvoiceDB"), and will use it, so feel free to set the data provider you want:

     <!-- 
         By default (convention over configuration, the connection string with the same name as your DBContext will be used 
         You can select then wherever you will use SQL CE, SQL Serer Express Edition, etc, here. 
     -->
     <add name="InvoiceDB" connectionString="Data Source=|DataDirectory|InvoiceDB.sdf" providerName="System.Data.SqlServerCe.4.0" />
     <!--
     <add name="InvoiceDB" connectionString="Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS; Integrated Security=True; MultipleActiveResultSets=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
     <add name="InvoiceDB" connectionString="metadata=res://*;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string=&quot;Data Source=mssql2005a.active-ns.com;Initial Catalog=xxxxxxxxxx.org;user id=xxxxxxxxxxxx;password=xxxxxxxxxxx;MultipleActiveResultSets=True&quot;" providerName="System.Data.EntityClient" />
     -->
